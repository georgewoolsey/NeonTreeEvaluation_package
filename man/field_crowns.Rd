\title{Compute evaluation statistics for one plot of field-annotated crowns}
\usage{
field_crowns(x, show = TRUE, project_boxes = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{submission csv table or polygon shp file}

\item{show}{Logical. Plot the overlayed annotations for each plot?}

\item{project_boxes}{Logical. Should the boxes be projected into utm coordinates? This is needed if the box coordinates are given from the image origin (top left is 0,0)}

\item{compute_PR}{Logical. Should the average precision and recall be computed?}
}
\value{
If compute_PR=T, the recall and precision scores for the plot, if False, the intersection-over-union scores for each prediction.
}
\description{
Compute evaluation statistics for one plot of field-annotated crowns
}
\details{
The format of the submission is either a csv with 5 columns: plot_name, xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax with #' Each row contains information for one predicted bounding box or a shp file of unprojected polygons.
The plot column should be named the same as the files in the dataset (e.g. SJER_021), not the path to the file (e.g. /path/to/SJER_021.tif).
