\title{Compute evaluation statistics for one plot}
\usage{
image_crowns(predictions, show = TRUE, project_boxes = TRUE)

image_crowns(predictions, show = TRUE, project_boxes = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{predictions}{The format of the submission is either a csv with 5 columns: plot_name, xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax or a sf polygon object with poylgons in image coordinates.
Each row contains information for one predicted bounding box.
The plot column should be named the same as the files in the dataset (e.g. SJER_021), not the path to the file.}

\item{show}{Logical. Plot the overlayed annotations for each plot?}

\item{project_boxes}{Logical. Should the boxes be projected into utm coordinates? This is needed if the box coordinates are given from the image origin (top left is 0,0)}

\item{submission}{A five column dataframe in the order plot_name, xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax. Each row is a predicted bounding box.}

\item{compute_PR}{Logical. Should the average precision and recall be computed?}

\item{show}{Logical. Plot the overlayed annotations for each plot?}

\item{project_boxes}{Logical. Should the boxes be projected into utm coordinates? This is needed if the box coordinates are given from the image origin (top left is 0,0)}

\item{compute_PR}{Logical. Should the average precision and recall be computed?}
}
\value{
If compute_PR=T, the recall and precision scores for the plot, if False, the intersection-over-union scores for each prediction.

If compute_PR=T, the recall and precision scores for the plot, if False, the intersection-over-union scores for each prediction.
